# 2d -> 3d with depth anything

demo: https://x.com/MrThinger/status/1791967698819358882

this is a raw (cursed) repo. here are some highlights:

- `aio_chunked.py` is a depth anything video inference rewrite

- `aio_chunked.py` expects `checkpoints/depth_anything_vitl14.pth` to exist

- `to_stereo.py` is depth to side by side video
